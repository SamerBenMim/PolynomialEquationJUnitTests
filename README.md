# PolynomialEquationJUnitTests

This package provides a class PolynomeSecondDegre that calculates the roots of a quadratic polynomial equation. The class has methods to calculate the discriminant and the roots of the equation.

Additionally, a class of JUnit tests, TestEquationSecondDegre, is provided to test the PolynomeSecondDegre class. The test class includes three methods to test the calculation of roots for a quadratic equation with two roots, one root, and no real roots. The tests are executed recursively using the JUnit framework and the results are collected in a TestResult object.

The package is designed to simplify the process of testing quadratic polynomial equations by providing a simple and efficient implementation using JUnit. Users can use this package to test their quadratic polynomial equations in their Java projects.
